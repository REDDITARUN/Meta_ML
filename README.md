# Meta-Learning Codebooks 

This repository contains implementation code for two significant meta-learning models: Siamese Networks for face recognition and Prototypical Networks for classification tasks. These models represent cutting-edge approaches in machine learning that facilitate the process of learning from fewer examples with high efficiency.

## Models in this Repository

### Siamese Networks for Face Recognition

Siamese Networks are uniquely effective for tasks that involve verifying whether two inputs are similar or dissimilar. They are especially well-suited for face recognition tasks, leveraging twin networks to compare features with remarkable precision.

**Notebook:** `Meta_Learning_1_Siamese_Network_Face_Recognition.ipynb`

### Prototypical Networks for Classification

Prototypical Networks excel in classifying data into categories based on few examples by learning a metric space in which classification can be performed by computing distances to prototype representations of each class.

**Notebook:** `Meta_Learning_2_Prototypical_Network_Face_Classification.ipynb`
